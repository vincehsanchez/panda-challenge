    "Scores by school spending identifies that quality and value are indicators of higher academic performance. The data shows that schools in the lower end of the spending spectrum had better passing rates than schools that spend more per student. \n",
    "\n",
    "The school size also shows that children perform better when there is more time dedicated to them; smaller class sizes help students perform better. Probably from low ratios between students and teachers while offering an environment where students can build their confidence socially and academically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing school types, charter schools do better academically since they need to maintain their public funding from governing bodies and philanthropies. This need for charter schools to fund possibly encourages proactive teaching and building upon strategies that helped their students succeed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scores by school spending does not consider other factors for higher spending, such as extracurricular activates or school equipment/materials (laptops, workbooks, etc.) which district schools usually offer. Charter school families usually have the financial means to pay for extracurriculars (and more specialized extracurriculars) outside of the school day and school equipment/materials. More data is needed for the financial accessibility of extracurriculars and school equipment/materials for students between charter schools and district schools, and if possible, whether they are school or third-party funded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although most charter schools are non-profit, they behave or are treated as for-profit and survive off public funds and philanthropic donations to stay open. Therefore, they have stricter standards to adhere by while also seeking approval for their efforts from philanthropic funding, usually by families that send their children to these schools. This limits the demographic diversity for charter schools due to affluent families doing whatever it takes (moving) to ensure their children get a private-school education at a public-school price but widens the inaccessibility of quality education for children and families that do that have the means to attend a charter school. Instead of encouraging charter schools and their lottery lists or school-choice, we should encourage the building of more district schools that lower the ratio between students and teachers which will naturally spread out the best teaching talent. This will discourage family migrations to high performing schools that force out underserved children and one day close the gap for accessibility of quality education.\n",
