# panda-challenge
In this assignment, we create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, we create a report that includes the following data. Our report includes a 

written description of observable trends based on the data.

### District Summary

Calculate then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame with the following:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### School Summary
Calculate and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school with the following:
- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Passing math rate (the percentage of students who passed math)
- Passing reading rate (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- Overall passing rate (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
- Highest-Performing Schools (by Overall Passing)

Sort schools by Overall Passing in **descending** order and display the top 5 rows.

Sort schools by Overall Passing in **ascending** order and display the top 5 rows.

### Math Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the **average math score** by grade at each school by grade:
- 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th

### Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the **average reading score** at each school by grade:
- 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th
### Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
Use bins to create reasonable cutoff values for grouping school spending.
Calculate mean scores per spending range.
Create a DataFrame called spending_summary with the following metrics in the table:
	Average math score
	Average reading score
	Passing math rate (the percentage of students who passed math)
	Passing reading rate (the percentage of students who passed reading)
	Overall passing rate (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Size
Use bins to create a DataFrame called size_summary comparing school performance based and school size:
- small, medium, large

### Scores by School Type
Create a new DataFrame to show school performance based on the "School Type":
- Charter, District
