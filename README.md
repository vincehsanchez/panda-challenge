In this assignment, we create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Our report must include
a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
